## What to expect from here on out
# Accounting

## How Financial Statements Link Together
1. **[Income Statement]** Net Income from income statement => top of the CF statement
2. **[Cash Flow Statement]** Adjust Net Income line for non-cash items
4. **[Cash Flow Statement]** Investing and financing activities which may increase or reduce cash flow, get net change in cash
5. **[Cash Flow Statement]** Cash at the bottom of CFS becomes Cash on B/S.
6. **[Balance Sheet]** Net income, stock issuances, stock repurchases, stock based compensation, and dividends link into CSE
7. **[Balance Sheet]** Link separate line items on the CFS to their corresponding balance sheet line items. CapEx and depreciation link into net PP&E
    - On Asset side, subtract CFS links
    - On L&E side, add CFS links
