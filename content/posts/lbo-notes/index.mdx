### Walk through a basic LBO Model
1. Make assumptions for purchase price, Debt and Equity, Interest rate on debt, and other variable such as company’s revenue growth and margins
2. Sources and Uses Schedule to show how much equity the PE firm contributes
3. Project Income Statement and partial cash flow statement down to FCF
4. Use FCF, Beginning Cash, and Min Cash to determine how much debt principal to pay each year, link the interest expense to the income statement
5. Make exit calculations

### How to make an investment decision based on an LBO Model’s output

Why recommend even if IRRs and MoM multiples are not favorable
* Levers to boost returns, such as excess cash to do dividend recap 

What makes an industry appealing
- If it’s growing more quickly and highly fragmented
- Less appealing if highly consolidated, in decline, or highly speculative

Most appealing value lever between volume growth, pricing growth, or expense cutting
