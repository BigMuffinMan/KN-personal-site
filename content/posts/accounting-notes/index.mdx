## How Financial Statements Link Together
1. **[Income Statement]** Net Income from income statement => top of the CF statement
2. **[Cash Flow Statement]** Adjust Net Income line for non-cash items
4. **[Cash Flow Statement]** Investing and financing activities which may increase or reduce cash flow, get net change in cash
5. **[Cash Flow Statement]** Cash at the bottom of CFS becomes Cash on B/S.
6. **[Balance Sheet]** Net income, stock issuances, stock repurchases, stock based compensation, and dividends link into CSE
7. **[Balance Sheet]** Link separate line items on the CFS to their corresponding balance sheet line items. CapEx and depreciation link into net PP&E
    - On Asset side, subtract CFS links
    - On L&E side, add CFS links

## Balance Sheet

### *Working Capital Assets/Liabilities*

| Assets | Liabilities|
| -------|------------|
| Accounts Receivable *(Recognised revenue, yet to receive cash)*| Deferred Revenue *(Did not recognise revenue, received cash)*|
| Prepaid Expenses *(Have not recognised expenses, paid cash)* | Accounts Payable *(Have recognised expense, yet to pay cash)* |
| | Accrued Expenses *(Have recognised expense, yet to pay cash)*|

Whether -ve working capital is good/bad depends on why
Chaange in WC tells you if company needs to spend in advance to grow, or if it generates more cash as a result of growth

### *Inventory*

||IFRS|GAAP|Inv cost +|Inv cost -|
|--|--|--|--|--|
|FIFO|X|X|	COGs lower, net income higher, ending inventory higher, cash flow lower|COGs higher, net income lower, ending inventory lower, cash flow higher|
LIFO||X|COGs higher, net income lower, ending inventory lower, cash flow higher	COGs lower, net income higher, ending inventory higher, CF lower|


### *Capital Expenditures*

* Growth vs Maintenance CapEx
    * Growth CapEx and Revenue growth closely tied, along with working capital 
    * Depreciation / CapEx ratio should converge to 1x over time

+ Capitalize vs Expen
    + Capitalize Fixed Assets and intangible assets, benefits >1 year
        + Land cannot be depreciated
        + Goodwill cannot be amortized, but is instead tested for impariment on an annual basis
        + Net Book Value = pruchase 
    + Expense short term benefits less than 1 year

- Depreciation Methods
    - Straight Line Depreciation
    - Double declining method 
        > (100%/useful life)*2
    - Units produced method 
        > (units produced / lifetime capacity)
    - Sum of Digits 
        > (remaining life / Sum of Digits)

### *Goodwill/Write-Downs/Impairments*
- Impairment: when market value drops below historical cost
- Tax accounting
    - **Asset Sale**: Tax Deductible, non-amortizable
    - **Stock Sale**: Non-Tax Deductible, non-amortizable
    - Impairments are not tax deductible
        > Book taxes fall but cash taxes stay the same, pay less cash taxes than book taxes in the future, DTA increases

### *Stock Repurchases*
- Dividends reduce cash
- Stock Repurchases reduce cash and share count
- Stock Repurchases are not tax deductible, increases DTA
- Initial issuance does nto affect cash balance, which is the key difference vs Depreciation
- Mechanics identical to impairments
- Components:
    - Common Stock
    - Additional Paid In Capital  (valued at par value @ first issuance)
    - Retained Earnings
    - Treasury Stock
    - AOCI

|Depreciation|Impairments|Stock Repurchase|
|------------|-----------|----------------|

### *Deferred Tax*

**Deferred Tax Liability**: Created when company expected to pay *higher* cash taxes than book taxes in the future

**Deferred Tax Asset**: Created when company is expected to pay *lower* cash taxes than book taxes in the future

- Net Operating Loss (NOL) is a type of DTA created when a company has lost money in previous years. It can reduce cash taxes in the future by applying these losses to reduce taxable income

SBC/Amortization of intangibles, various write-downs and impairments all book tax but not cash tax deductible


### *Operating and Finance Leases*
||Operating Lease|Finance Lease|
|------------|-----------|-----|
|IS|Deduct Rent|Deduct Depreciation and Interest Expense|
|CFS| Operating Lease Assets & Liabilities offset each other
|BS|Both lease assets and lease liabilities decrease each year until the lease ends|?|

    > IFRS: Operating leases work the same as finance leases, 
        [IS] companies record interest and depreciation on the income statement, 
        [CFS] add back depreciation on the Cash Flow statement, subtract lease princiopal repayment further down on the CFS

### *Balance Sheet Metrics*

*Returns Based Metrics*
|Metrics|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|--|--|--|
|ROE|||
|ROA|||
|ROIC|||

>**ROIC** = NOPAT/[Equity + Debt + Prefs + Other LT Funding]

>**ROA** = Net income to common  / Avg Assets

>**ROE** = Net income to common  / Avg Sh Equity

*Credit Metrics*

>**Leverage Ratio**: Total Debt/EBITDA

>**ICR**: EBITDA/Interest Expense


*Cash Conversion Metrics*

>**DSO**: Accounts Receivable/Revenues * 365

>**DIO**: Inventory / COGs * 365

>**DPO**: Accounts Payable / COGs * 365
>Cash Conversion Cycle = DSO + DIO - DPO

### *Equity Method / Consolidation*

||Ownership|Treatment|
|--|--|--|
|Equity Method|less than  50%|**IS:** ownership% * sub income **CFS:** reverse line, add ownership% * sub dividend **BS:** creates and asset that increases by equity investment earnings, and decreases by dividends|
|Consolidation| >50%||
|Security|small %||

**Equity Method**
Market Cap Increases
+ Change does not appear on IS, unless parent sells some of the stake based on the new market cap
+ Unrealised gains and losses on equity investments do not appear, only realised gains and losses

Ownership % changes (sell only)
1. First get Cost Basis, which is equity investments in the previous period + equity investment earnings - dividends
2. Find the original value of the sake bought, deduct the new value now (cost basis?), and then adjust for % of stake you actually sell
3. Impact on 3FS:
    - [IS]: add realises gains/losses on IS, equity investment earnings will change because ownership % changes
    - [CFS]: reverse all gains and losses, normal earnings/dividends line items also show up here
    - [BS]: Earnings/Divs/Gains&losses/Purchases&sales all flow into balance sheet item


**Consolidation**
-	Financial statements are consolidated 100%
    - IS: deduction of (1-ownership%) * sub net income
    - CFS: reverse this line item because parent does get the net income in cash. Combine dividends of parent and sub, also add sub co’s dividends * ownership%
    - Balance sheet (see below)

1.	Write down sub equity
2.	Add new good will
3.	Eliminate old equity investments
4.	Deduct cash used to fund deal
5.	Add debt
6.	Add common stock issued
7.	NOTE: Asset side, debit means add, credit means subtract (when you add an assets, you pay up “debited”)
    - Liabilities, debit means subtract, credit means add

Notes
1.	Deduct the equity investments line
2.	CSE will record the discount/premium to book value of existing stake


Income Statement	
Balance Sheet	CSE: common shareholder’s equity + retained earnings – parent divs – stock repurchase + stock issuance (leave out sub divs)
Cash Flow Statement	Dividends: add dividends from the ownership% * sub dividends because we do not actually lose 100% of dividends
Equity investment earnings and NCI
Divs from partially owned companies
Cash:

If >50% impacts:
NCI
Equity iinvestments

NCI acts as a mini-shareholders’ equity line item for minority shareholders in sub co.

De-consolidation, move back below 50% ownership
1.	Noncontrolling interest is removed, and a new equity investment line item is created
2.	Need to assume a market cap for this sub co. when ownership change takes place at end of 4 year period
Gain/Loss calculation: Market value of stake sold + market value of new equity investment + book value of NCI being removed – net assets of sub (including goodwill created in previous deal)
-	Why even add the book value of the NCI (?)
-	Net assets of sub is the cost basis
-	Only pay tax on the gains


## Cash Flow Statement

||Definition|
|--|--|
|FCF|CFO - CapEx, IFRS removes the lease depreciation add-back because company still pays the full lease expense in cash|
|FCFe||
|FCFf||

*Cash Flow Proxy*

**EBIT**: FCF
**EBITDA**: CFO, non-GAAP measure

## Income Statement

### *Restructuring Costs*
|IS|BS|CFS|
|--|--|--|
|Expense when charges are taken into account|Creates a restructuring liability when charges are taken into account|Non-cash portion increases cash from operating when charges are taken|
|No expense when future cash outlays are made|Liability is reduced by the amount of cash outlay made|Cash outlays decrease cash from operating when made|

**Examples of Restructuring Costs**
- One-time benefits
- Costs of terminating contracts
- Costs of moving employees
**Steps in recognising Restructuring Costs**
1. [IS] less restructuring charge discounted to PV
2. [IS] Recognise the discount and deduct on IS
3. [BS] Accrestion expense is added to the liability, by end of the period, liability should equal to the undiscounted restructuring liability



## Main Modelling Elements
**Income Statement**: Split up Revenue and Expense drivers, show depreciation & amortization as separate line itmes
**Balance Sheet**: Combine ST and LT versions of items, make a single net DTA line, one line for CSE
**Cash Flow Statement**: Consolidate smaller items between net income and change in working capital
- for CFI and CFF: CapEx, Equity and Debt Issuances, Stock Repurchases, Debt Repayments, and Dividends
- Equity and Debt Issuance: Only impacts cash flow from financing initially.
    >- Equity: Share count increases, diluting existing investors
    >- Debt: Company must pay interest, which will be recorded on its IS, reducing net income and cash, and it must fully repay

## GAAP vs IFRS

GAAP classified all fixed assets into predetermined baskets to estimate their useful life
Cost of the asset includes everything needed to get the asset ready for use (including shipping costs, building costs etc)

||GAAP|IFRS|
|--|--|--|
|Balance Sheet|Most Liquid to least liquid|Least Liquid to most liquid|
|Cash Flow|Interest paid and received classfied as op activities, Dividends are in financing|Flexible. Also starts CFS with operating income|
|Asset Revaluation|Does not allow for asset's value to be written back up after impairment|allows for revaluation up to original cost|
|Inventory Revaluation|FIFO/LIFO/WeightedAvg|No LIFO|
|Leases|Rental expense within operating expenses|Operating lease expense split into interest and depreciation elements|

## Questions on changes to 3 Statements


### *Working Capital Changes*

||Increases|Decreases
|--|--|--|
|Accounts Receivable (A)|	IS (+rev)| |	
|Prepaid Expenses (A)||IS (+expenses)|
|Inventory (A)|	|IS (+COGs)|
|Accounts Payable (L)|IS (+expenses, not necessarily)||	
|Accrued Expenses (L)|IS (+expenses)||	
|Deferred Revenue (L)||IS (+Rev)|


### *Lease Changes*
For all lease qns, when lease first signed, lease asset and lease liability both increase by the same amount on the balance sheet
- **FINANCE lease**: records interest expense and depreciation on the lease
    - Interest expense = discount rate * lease liability
    - Depreciation = initial lease asset/lease term
    - Lease principal payment (on CFS) = Cash lease expense – interest expense
- **OPERATING lease (under GAAP)**
    - IS: rental expense
    - Interest expense = Discount rate * lease liability
    - Depreciation = cash lease – interest expense
    - Lease principal repayment = straight line rental expense – interest expense
